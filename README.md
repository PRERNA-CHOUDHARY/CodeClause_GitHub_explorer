# CodeClause_GitHub_explorer

This is a simple web application that allows users to search for repositories on GitHub using the GitHub API. 

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Getting Started

To get started with the application, simply open the `index.html` file in your browser.

## Usage

To use the application, enter a search query in the input field and click the "Search" button. The application will then make a call to the GitHub API and display the search results in a list.

## Styling

The styling for the application is contained in the `githubstyle.css` file. The styles include a centered heading, an input field and button for search, and a list to display the search results. 

## Functionality

The `search` function in the JavaScript code makes a call to the GitHub API using the `fetch` method. It then processes the response data and displays the search results in the list on the web page.

## Credits

This application was created by Prerna Choudhary during CodeClause Internship.
